```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4">
  <!-- Content -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient functionality.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are too visually similar, the gradient might not be noticeable, creating a subtle bug where the intended visual effect is absent.  Another issue might arise if the `p-4` padding creates an unexpected visual overflow or spacing problem depending on the parent container.
